// Strings


// Stored series of characters
// Can be assigned any text inside quotes.
// Can be single or double quotes.
// Using quotes inside the string should be opposite type of quotes from the outside.


var firstName = "Andrew";
var lastName = "Davis";

console.log(firstName + " " + lastName);

// Special characters such as apostrophies can interfere with the string.
// The way to prevent this from happening is to use the escape character(\)



var phrase = "This is Andrew\'s computer";

// Built in property called .length

var person = "Mike";
var per = person.length;

console.log(per);
